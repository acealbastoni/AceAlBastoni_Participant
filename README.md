Personal Projects Under Development:
1."AceAlBastoni" project
This is a personal software project that designed and developed from the scratch by “Mohamed AbdElHamid” to send 600k message a day, I use it for other personal purposes as sending my CV, manages a group of my different drive accounts and sometimes I use it to increase viewers for a video, advertisement or others.
The project is bigger than just sending a message, advertisement, emails, links or attached files  to 600 K person a day; But the project also has a technique I developed for addressing many email addresses that  returned with rejection, puts them in a local Spreadsheet called (removed), which is located on the sender account drive (participant) and finally puts them in a public Database contains invalid emails in order not to send them again at any time to keep the quota limits per day for every free participant account.
And also presents a chart using "Google Visualization API" and "Google Charts API" through which the data states are represented accurately and more readable way.
As well as, “AceAlBastoni” project applies The statistical natural distribution theory on the count of the new Email Addresses which is registered for the first time on the system every day compared to the last thirty days to show the noticeable shortage (W-||W--||W---) and the noticeable increase (W+||W++||W+++) as anomalies cases; also it Represents the Normal count of the new registered email addresses compared to the last thirty days counts as ("N"). All this is applied through statistical equations related to standard deviation, mean, and median.
